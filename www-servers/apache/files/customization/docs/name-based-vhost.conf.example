# Name-based virtual host
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html
#
# Name-based virtual hosts are the easiest to setup and should be used
# unless you have to have seperate IP addresses for each website.
#
# This file is here to serve as an example. You should copy it and make changes
# to it before you use it. You can name the file anything you want, as long as 
# it ends in .conf
#
# To make management easier, we suggest using a seperate file for every virtual
# host you have, and naming the files like so: 00_www.example.com.conf
# This will allow you to easily make changes to certain virtual hosts without
# having to search through every file to find where it's defined at.


# If you are using name-based virtual hosts, you must desginate which
# which connections (IP address and port of the server) that will be
# accepting requests for virtual hosts.
#
# DO NOT SET THE SAME DEFINITION MORE THEN ONCE, even in different files.
# These definitions also cannot overlap.
#
# If you want to use a defintion other then the default, you should remove
# -D DEFAULT_VHOST from APACHE2_OPTS in /etc/conf.d/apache2.

# The actual virtual host definition.
<VirtualHost *:80>
	# ServerName and ServerAlias are how the server determines which virtual
	# host should be used.
	ServerName example.com
	ServerAlias www.example.com

	# Note the ServerAlias allows a few simple wildcards. If you want to have
	# every subdomain of example.com point to the same place you can do this:
	# ServerAlias *.example.com

	# DocumentRoot is the location where your files will be stored
	#
	# For gentoo, the suggested structure is:
	#
	# /var/www/
	#   domain.com/
	#     htdocs/        Files for the website itself
	#     htdocs-secure/ Files available via HTTPS (requires seperate config)
	#     cgi-bin/       Site-specific executable scripts (optional)
	#     error/         Custom error pages for the website (optional)
	#     icons/         Custom icons for the website (optional)
	#     
	# You should also set the vhost USE-flag so that you can install webapps
	# easily to multiple virtual hosts
	#
	# Note that if you put the directory anywhere other then under /var/www
	# you may run into problems with suexec and cgi scripts.
	#
	DocumentRoot "/var/www/example.com/htdocs"

	# This should match the DocumentRoot above
	<Directory "/var/www/example.com/htdocs">
		# Some sane defaults - see httpd.conf for details
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

	# By default cgi-bin points to the global cgi-bin in /var/www/localhost
	# If you want site specific executable scripts, then uncomment this section
	#
	# If you have enabled suexec, you will want to make sure that the cgi-bin 
	# directory is owned by the user and group specified with SuexecUserGroup
	
	#ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/example.com/cgi-bin/"
	#<Directory "/var/www/example.com/cgi-bin">
	#	AllowOverride None

	#</Directory>

	# If you have multiple users on this system, each with their own vhost,
	# then it's a good idea to use suexec to seperate them.
	#
	# Set the user and group that scripts in this virtual host will run as.
	<IfDefine SUEXEC>
